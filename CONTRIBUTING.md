# Contributing Guide

## Getting Started
To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Open Unity Hub.
1. Click on the New Project button in the top right.
1. Select the 3D template.
1. Name your project and choose where to store it.
1. Select the Unity Editor version (2020.3.21f1 is recommended).
1. Click the Create Project button.
1. Open a terminal and navigate to the Assets directory of the project.
1. Clone this repository using the following command:
    > git clone https://github.com/Preponderous-Software/beyond-nations
1. In Unity, navigate to the beyond-nations/src directory, which should now be in the Assets folder.
1. Double click on the main scene to open it.

### Troubleshooting
If you encounter a Missing Editor Version error, it's because you tried to open the repository folder directly as a Unity project. It's recommended to clone the repository inside the Assets folder of an existing empty project.

## Branching
To keep the codebase organized, we use a branching model that is similar to Git Flow. The main branch is the default branch, and it contains the latest stable version of the codebase. The develop branch contains the latest version of the codebase, and it is the branch that should be used for development.

## Pull Requests
To contribute to the project, you must create a pull request. A pull request is a request to merge your changes into the develop branch. To create a pull request, follow these steps:
1. Create a new branch from the develop branch.
1. Make your changes.
1. Commit your changes.
1. Push your changes to the remote repository.
1. Create a pull request on GitHub.

## Issues
